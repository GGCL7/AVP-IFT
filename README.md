# Welcome to: A two-stage computational framework for identifying antiviral peptides and their functional types based on contrastive learning and multi-feature fusion strategy
Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have shown potential in inhibiting viral attachment, preventing viral fusion with host cells and disrupting viral replication due to their unique action mechanisms. They have now become a broad-spectrum, promising antiviral therapy. However, identifying effective AVPs is traditionally slow and costly. This study proposed a new two-stage computational framework for AVP identification. The first stage identifies AVPs from a wide range of peptides, and the second stage recognises AVPs targeting specific families or viruses. This method integrates contrastive learning and multi-feature fusion strategy, focusing on sequence information and peptide characteristics, significantly enhancing predictive ability and interpretability. The evaluation results of the model show excellent performance, with accuracy of 0.9240 and MCC score of 0.8482 on the non-AVP independent dataset, and accuracy of 0.9934 and MCC score of 0.9869 on the non-AMP independent dataset. Furthermore, our model can predict antiviral activities of AVPs against six key viral families (Coronaviridae, Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae) and eight viruses (FIV, HCV, HIV, HPIV3, HSV1, INFVA, RSV, SARS-CoV).
